It's a reminder that I'm not just in it for the easy wins – I'm here to fight for justice, even when it's tough as nails.</p><br/>

Mr. Harkness, adamant about identifying the wrong guy, seemed pretty confident. But guess what? I, Jimmy McGill, had a trick up my sleeve. With a little twist of words and some clever maneuvering, I unveiled the truth – the real defendant was sitting pretty in the audience. It was a twist that shook the whole courtroom, and in the end, I got that mistrial. Call it a legal hustle or a masterstroke, one thing's for sure: Jimmy McGill knows how to turn the tables when it counts.</p><br/>
